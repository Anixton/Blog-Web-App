      My journey into web development began with a curiosity to understand how
      the digital world operates. Through self-study and hands-on projects, I've
      honed my skills With a solid foundation in both back-end and front-end
      development, I excel in creating responsive and intuitive web
      applications. I am gaining experience in the MERN stack and am eager to
      learn new technologies to further my career as a web developer.
